//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla";


// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Red Panda");


// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
// "Elephant" was removed from the animals array when the last item was
// reassigned to "Gorilla". This code will log "Gorilla". Otherwise "Elephant"
// could be added back into the array.
console.log(animals[2]);


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var vegetables = ['carrot','onion','pepper','garlic'];


// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(vegetables.length);


// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
vegetables.unshift('broccoli');
console.log(vegetables);


// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
vegetables.pop();
console.log(vegetables);


// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
vegetables.push('eggplant','turnip','kale');
console.log(vegetables);


// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
vegetables.shift();


//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: FitBit app: var restingHeartRate =[46,48,47,50,53];
// 2: FitBit :  var exercises = ['Run','Weights','Hike','Yoga','Intervals'];
// 3: Fitbit: var drinkWater = ['glass','bottle','large bottle'];

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 13;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "house";

// Write your conditional here
//Declares condition 1
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  //block of code executes if condition 1 is true
  console.log('I can call an Uber');
  //Declares condition 2, to be evaluated if condition 1 is false
} else if (percentBatteryLeft < 15 && hasCharger === false) {
  //block of code is executed if condition 1 is false and condition 2 is true
  console.log('I cannot call an uber');
  //Declares condition 3 to be evaluated if conditions 1 and 2 are false
} else if (percentBatteryLeft < 15 && chargerType !== 'car') {
  //block of code executes if conditions 1 and 2 are false and condition 3 is true
  console.log('I cannot call an uber');
  //Block of code executes if conditions 1-3 are evaluated to be false.
} else {
  console.log('I can call an uber');
}


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ

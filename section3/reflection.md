## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
   - Mistakes are essential to learning: This is something that I understand on principal but I frequently have to repeat to myself. We live in a society where mistakes are viewed in a negative light and frequently have negative outcomes. In coding I need to understand that I will make mistakes, but that I have other people to help me rectify them if I get stuck and help me determine where the code went wrong.
   - Seek help/feedback is the second growth mindset that resonated with me. I enjoy collaborating with others and because I don't want to make mistakes I have learned as an adult how important asking others for help when I am stuck can be. Even if I am not stuck, having someone review something before I submit it can be helpful in preventing mistakes.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
   - I like to challenge myself, even when it feels scary. I enjoy learning and pushing my boundaries. Making the switch from healthcare to coding feels like a huge jump, but the process of learning something new is enjoyable to me.
   - Once I have an understanding of a concept, I do not always go back and practice the way I should. I get practice in as I work, but I know that I should be more deliberate in going back to specific concepts to spend time on them.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
   - Spotify: developers would use arrays for playlists. Each song in the playlist is an element of the array. Every playlist is its own array. Every artist page has its own set of arrays. Each album on an artist page is its own array.  

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
   - An array is a method of organizing lists or set of related items/values. Rather than each item being an individual variable, you can put it in an array to group them. Each item can still be called on its own from the array with the right set of code.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
   - Loops are used to check a condition. If a condition evaluates to true, a block of code runs. If the condition evaluates to false, it is checked again and again until it evaluates to true the code block can be run. We would use a loop with an array if we want to check a condition for each item in an array. Loops can be used without an array frequently when we just need to check one or a few variables against a condition or several conditions.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
   - A loop is used when I type in my password to something and I type it incorrectly. It will return the message that my password is incorrect, and continue to output that message as long as my password is wrong. Once I type in my password correctly, the code block will run and log me into my account on a website.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
   - I don't know that I have any questions about them at this moment from what I have learned. I am sure as I move further into it and they become more complicated questions will arise.

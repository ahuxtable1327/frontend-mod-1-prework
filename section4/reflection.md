## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
  - My work actually felt a little more disjointed in some ways. I already have a habit of creating stopping points and giving myself breaks, but I usually do this when it makes sense in the work, like after I have finished taking notes but before I have started an exercise. I added the Pomodoro extension to my browser for this last section. In some ways it was frustrating and it others it was good. Sometimes it would pop up right in the middle of working on an exercise and writing code. That could be annoying because it would disrupt my train of thought.  But there were a few times that happened and I had been stuck for quite a few minutes. The break was good because I came back with new eyes. I think I prefer giving myself breaks on my own time, but I can see how having a timer and setting goals for each time period can be beneficial.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
   - I think setting the intentions for each time period was really useful. For some of my time periods I reached my goal before the time was up. I utilized that time to review my notes or look back over my code to ensure everything looked okay. As previously mentioned, on some things that took a little longer than intended, the reminder to take a break was a little annoying. Especially if I was close to the end.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
   - Objects are a way to store more complex data. They are similar to arrays in that you can store multiple values in one place. But arrays store this information in ordered lists and that can only be accessed by the index number. Objects allow you to store all other data types and you can access each piece of information using strings.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
     - Array: If I just need the student names, then an array is an easy way to store information that only has one value per element.
  * List of states and their capitals
     - Object: Although it would be a simple list, states and capitals would be more readable and easier to call in the object form because you can use strings to get the data.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
     - Array: It is easy to add an item to the array or remove one. It's a relatively simple list that shouldn't need more information.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
     - Object: You could store both the account name and the name of the person who holds the account. This makes it easier to view, since many people don't use their names in the username. It also makes it easier to change the username. There is a lot more data that goes into the instagram accounts that would be pertinent.
  * List of student names and their cohort
     - Object: By listing the students and the cohort, it makes it easier to organize students by cohort and retrieve the data
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
     - Object: Once again, you can be more specific by using an object. Even though you can store strings and numbers in arrays, recalling that information for a recipe would be difficult.
  * All my favorite restaurants
     - Array: Once again, I feel like this could be put in an array because it would be a relatively simple ordered list. There is not much information required.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
   - MyFitnessPal uses data about myself in order to properly calculate my caloric needs. This is likely stored in an object.
   ` var userInfo = {
        name: "Ashton",
        height: "70 inches",
        age: 28,
        weight: 170
        activity: "moderate",
     }`


6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
   - I'm not sure I completely understand methods within a class and how to properly write code in order to affect the constructor. I know this will come with time and practice and part of it is just knowing how to properly use all of the information we have covered so far.
